- OpenAI Responses (`openai-responses` and the Codex subscription transport):
  a tool result that carries images is now sent as a native
  `function_call_output.output` array of `input_text` / `input_image` parts.
  Both the `OpenAIResponsesFormatter` and the subscription input normalizer
  previously `JSON.stringify`'d any non-string tool-result content, so the
  model received the image's base64 as text: it could not see the image, and
  a single ~760 KB screenshot cost roughly 500k input tokens (the same image as
  a native part is ~500). Normalized content arrays, including recursively
  nested tool results, use the shared `responsesToolResultOutput` typed-part
  projection; string content stays a string. Provider-native replay items
  remain byte-identical. The superseded flat `responsesToolOutputParts` helper
  and its callers are removed rather than retained as a compatibility alias.
